Look at the contents of the bunnings_website_search_api.md which contains the
endpoint, headers and payload used when searching for "Plywood" on the
www.bunnings.com.au website.




I want you to figure out python code required to search the <www.bunnings.com.au>
website without having an API key. The end result will be a python class which
will handle the search functionality, including managing cookies and headers for
requests to ensure successful interactions with the website.

The endpoint for search is https: //api.prod.bunnings.com.au/v1/coveo/search it
will require correct headers to be set for the requests to function properly.

Use the playwright MCP to figure out the best way to do this.
