Okay, here's an analysis of the network request and a curl command based on the provided details.

Analysis of the Network Request

Purpose:
The request targets https://api.prod.bunnings.com.au/v1/coveo/search, suggesting it's a search query against the Bunnings product catalog using the Coveo search engine.
The endpoint /v1/coveo/search implies it's using version 1 of the API and leverages Coveo for its search functionality.
The POST request method (inferred from the Content-Type: application/json and the presence of a payload) indicates that this is a complex search, probably with a JSON payload specifying search criteria and filters.
The origin https://www.bunnings.com.au indicates this request was likely initiated from the Bunnings Australia website.
The high number of request headers that include <redacted> values suggests that it has a lot of parameters that are specific to the current user and session.
Request Headers:
Accept: application/json, text/plain, */*: The client (browser) is indicating it can receive JSON, plain text, or any other content type.
Authorization: <redacted>: This indicates some form of authentication is in place, probably a token-based authentication (e.g., JWT).
Content-Type: application/json: The request body is in JSON format.
Origin: https://www.bunnings.com.au: The request originated from the Bunnings website.
The headers including clientId, correlationid, country, currency, locale, locationCode, sessionid, stream, and userId all contain specific information about the user, session, and location.
The X-region: header suggests it could be a header to indicate a specific region of the website that may have different content.
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br, zstd : The client accepts different types of compression.
User-Agent: standard header used to describe the client's browser.
Response Headers:
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://www.bunnings.com.au: Indicates that the API allows requests from the Bunnings website. This is crucial for cross-origin requests.
Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache: The response should not be cached. This is expected for search results which need to be current.
Content-Encoding: gzip: The response body is compressed with Gzip, which is good for performance.
Content-Type: application/json : The response will be in JSON format.
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: specifies all of the headers that can be in the request.
Response Status:
200 OK: This means the request was successful, and the server returned a valid response.
Timing Analysis:
Duration: 438.97 ms: The overall request took about 439 milliseconds, which is acceptable for a search query, especially one that might involve complex operations.
Waiting for server response: 414.43 ms: This is the most significant portion of the duration. It represents the time the browser spent waiting for the server to process the request. This is an area where the backend API might be optimized if consistently slow.
Queued at: 4.58s and Started at: 4.61s indicates that the request spent 22.61ms waiting in the queue. This is most likely because of the browser's network queue management.
The remaining timings are very small and probably won't be the main factors affecting performance.
Potential Issues:
The time spent waiting for the server response is long. It is good, but could potentially be optimized on the server side.
Lack of payload info: without knowing what was the actual data sent to the server, it's impossible to understand the actual search query.
The lack of a payload in the provided data makes it impossible to understand what the user actually searched.
Curl Command

Code

curl -X POST \
  'https://api.prod.bunnings.com.au/v1/coveo/search' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json, text/plain, */*' \
  -H 'Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br, zstd' \
  -H 'Accept-Language: en-GB,en-US;q=0.9,en;q=0.8' \
  -H 'Authorization: <redacted>' \
  -H 'Connection: keep-alive' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Host: api.prod.bunnings.com.au' \
  -H 'Origin: https://www.bunnings.com.au' \
  -H 'Referer: https://www.bunnings.com.au/' \
  -H 'Sec-Fetch-Dest: <redacted>' \
  -H 'Sec-Fetch-Mode: <redacted>' \
  -H 'Sec-Fetch-Site: <redacted>' \
  -H 'User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/135.0.0.0 Safari/537.36' \

  --data-raw '{}'
Use code snippets with caution

Explanation of the Curl Command:

-X POST: Specifies that it's a POST request.
'https://api.prod.bunnings.com.au/v1/coveo/search': The target URL.
-H: Specifies request headers, many of which were directly taken from the network request.
--data-raw '{}' : This is the most likely way to replicate the request. Since the request had Content-Type: application/json it indicates that a JSON payload is expected by the server. This example is using an empty JSON {} but should be replaced by the correct one.
Important Notes about the Curl Command:

Placeholders: The <redacted> placeholders in the curl command need to be replaced with the actual values from the original request if you intend to replicate that specific request. This is especially important for the Authorization, and custom headers.
Payload: The --data-raw '{}' is a placeholder. You'll need to replace it with the actual JSON payload sent in the original request to get meaningful results.
Context: This curl query is a starting point. You might need to modify it further based on the actual API documentation of Bunnings and Coveo.
I hope this helps you debug the network request!
