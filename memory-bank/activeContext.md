# Active Context: Wood Cut Calculator â€“ Codebase & Architecture Audit (April 2025)

## Current Focus

The codebase has been fully audited and refactored for clarity, maintainability, and strict alignment with the project specification. All legacy, redundant, and obsolete code has been removed. The system is now modular, robust, and ready for further development or feature expansion.

---

## Codebase State (Post-Audit)

### Modular Structure

- **`app.py`**: Main Flask application, handles routing, DB access, and template filters. Delegates all cutting plan logic to the modular backend. No legacy algorithm code remains.
- **`wood_cut_calc/`**: Contains all core logic, cleanly separated:
  - `cutting_algorithms.py`: Implements the two-phase (strict/wildcard) matching, cost/waste minimization, rotation, and unique solution generation. No legacy or redundant code.
  - `svg_generator.py`: Generates professional SVG diagrams with part labeling, dimensions, rotation, and waste visualization.
  - `routes.py`: Handles all cutting plan-related Flask routes, passing complete solution data to templates.
  - `__main__.py` and `__init__.py`: Provide CLI entrypoint and package-level imports. No side effects or legacy code.

### Template Filters

- **`custom_filters.py`**: Contains the only definition of `sum_previous_lengths`, registered via Flask blueprint. No duplication.

### Database & Migrations

- **`init_db.py`**: Safely initializes the database for development/testing.
- **`run_migrations.py`**: Orchestrates all migrations, ensures schema is up to date.
- **`migrations/`**: All migration scripts are idempotent, robust, and well-documented. No legacy or redundant logic.

### Integration & Data Flow

- All data flows from backend to frontend are clean and spec-compliant.
- The frontend receives and displays all required outputs (BOM, diagrams, part numbering, cost, waste, wildcard assignments).
- No data structure mismatches or integration gaps remain.

---

## Recent Changes

- Removal of all legacy/duplicate algorithm code from `app.py`.
- Registration of template filters via blueprint only (no duplication).
- Full audit and confirmation of all migration scripts.
- Documentation and code comments updated for clarity.

---

## Technical Debt & Issues

- Minor linter/style warnings (line length, blank lines, some unused imports) remain, but do not affect functionality.
- All functional, architectural, and integration issues have been resolved.

---

## Next Steps

- Continue to maintain modularity and clarity as new features are added.
- Address linter/style warnings as part of ongoing code quality improvements.
- Use the updated memory bank as the single source of truth for future development.

---

## Summary

The Wood Cut Calculator codebase is now clean, modular, and fully aligned with the project specification. All critical backend, frontend, and migration issues have been addressed. The system is ready for further development, feature expansion, or deployment.
