# Progress: Wood Cut Calculator â€“ Post-Audit Status (April 2025)

## What Works

- **Modular, Clean Architecture:** All core logic is now in `wood_cut_calc/` modules, with a clear separation of concerns.
- **Cutting Plan Algorithm:** The two-phase (strict/wildcard) matching, cost/waste minimization, rotation, and unique solution generation are robust and spec-compliant.
- **SVG Diagrams:** Professional, labeled, and accurate SVG diagrams are generated for each solution and sheet.
- **Frontend Integration:** All required outputs (BOM, diagrams, part numbering, cost, waste, wildcard assignments) are displayed in the UI.
- **Database & Migrations:** Schema is managed via robust, idempotent migration scripts. Initialization and migration flows are reliable.
- **Template Filters:** Only a single, blueprint-registered filter for `sum_previous_lengths` is used.
- **No Legacy or Redundant Code:** All obsolete, duplicate, or legacy logic has been removed from the codebase.

## What's Left to Build

- **Linter/Style Cleanup:** Minor Flake8 and Pylint warnings remain (line length, blank lines, some unused imports), but do not affect functionality.
- **Feature Expansion:** The system is ready for new features, enhancements, or deployment as needed.

## Current Status

- **All critical backend, frontend, and migration issues have been resolved.**
- **The codebase is clean, maintainable, and fully aligned with the project specification.**
- **The memory bank is now an accurate, up-to-date source of truth for the project.**

## Known Issues

- Minor linter/style warnings (non-blocking).
- No functional, architectural, or integration issues remain.

## Evolution of Decisions

- Legacy algorithm code was removed from `app.py` in favor of modular backend logic.
- Template filter registration was consolidated to avoid duplication.
- Migration scripts were confirmed to be robust, idempotent, and well-documented.
- All integration and data flow issues were resolved.

## Next Steps

- Maintain code quality and modularity as new features are added.
- Address linter/style warnings as part of ongoing improvements.
- Use the updated memory bank for all future development and onboarding.
